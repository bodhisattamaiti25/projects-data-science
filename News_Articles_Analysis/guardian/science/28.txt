Can you solve it? Catriona's colourful conundrums
Five beautiful geometrical puzzles
Today’s puzzles come from Catriona Shearer, a maths teacher at a school in north Essex, whose colourful geometry puzzles have recently gained a following on social media. These brainteasers are certainly pretty, and some are pretty tricky too!
Here are five of her best.
1. Orange segments
If the radius of each semicircle is 5, what’s the total shaded area?
2. Double spiral
Ten equally spaced dots are joined by semicircles to make this spiral. Is more of it shaded red or orange? By how much?
3. Yellow arbelos
The red line, of length 2, is perpendicular to the bases of the three semicircles. What’s the total shaded area?
4. Pink donut
The four dots are equally spaced. What’s the shaded area?
5. Blue triangle
The area of the bottom left square is 5. What’s the area of the blue triangle?
Catriona prefers devising geometry puzzles because – unlike puzzles from other areas of maths – you can often solve them in your head. “I really like puzzles where a bit of clever thinking can sidestep a whole page of algebra,” she says.
“Plus I enjoy colouring them in.”
I’ll be back at 5pm UK time with the solutions. Meanwhile, thanks to Catriona for the puzzles. If you enjoyed them, follow her on Twitter for many more.

In other two-dimensional geometry news, this tweet about pizza went viral last week. Who said maths was irrelevant to real life?

I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.
